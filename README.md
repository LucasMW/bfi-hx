# bfi-hx
Brainfuck implementation in Haxe. 'cause why not?

## Motivation 
I want to practice Haxe programming in a way I myself have working programs to consult later on. Building a brainfuck interpreter exposes a lot things of the *system console level* (for a lack of a better term) of the language. It's also a display of how such things would behavior in the different target Haxe can compile against.

## Get Started
Just clone the project and type 'make'
    
    git clone https://github.com/LucasMW/bfi-hx/
    cd bfi-hx
    make
  
If you see "Hello World!", it went fine.

This generates bfi as an executable at bin/cpp/bfi

## Requirements

It's worth mention that you may need have both **haxe** and **haxelib** installed.

Go to https://haxe.org/ for more details on that
